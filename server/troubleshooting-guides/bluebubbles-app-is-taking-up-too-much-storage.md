# BlueBubbles App is Taking Up Too Much Storage

## Why is the app taking up so much storage?

You likely receive a fair amount of images, videos, and other attachments from your friends. You may not realize, but after a long time these start to take up a lot of storage space.

## How can I clear the storage?

Luckily, there is a quick way to resolve this issue, built right into the BlueBubbles app.

1. Open the BlueBubbles App
2. Open `Settings` via the 3 dot menu
3. Scroll down to the bottom and click on `Reset`
4. Click `Remove Attachments`
   * Do not click `Yes` or else it will clear all of your chat data, and have you re-sync with your server.

Now, check the storage space used by the app, and it should be significantly less.

Currently, we don't automatically purge old attachments, however, it's something that we may implement in the future.
