# Phone Number Registration Methods
While a Mac can send and recieve iMessages, it can only do so from an email address if no iPhone linked.  To use BlueBubbles with a phone number, an iPhone must be linked to iMessage.

## Current Methods
All of these methods require a spare iPhone as well as your current phone with an active SIM.

### Non-Jailbreak Methods

  Some of the methods require keeping an inactive SIM card in an iPhone while others involve removing the SIM card from the iPhone and leaving it turned off.

## Outdated Methods
These methods should not be used.

  The app originally sent scheduled registration messages to Apple directly from the app without the need for an iPhone. Apple has blocked the iPhone-less method and this no longer works.  
  Beeper Mini has been updated to be used with a jailbroken iPhone, and a community-maintained rewritten version of that can be found at [beepserv-rewrite - GitHub](https://github.com/thatmarcel/beepserv-rewrite).  

* **[pypush at sms-registration - GitHub](https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush/tree/sms-registration)**  
  This method sent scheduled registration messages to Apple from any computer (that can run Python) without the need for an iPhone. Apple has blocked this method and this no longer works.
