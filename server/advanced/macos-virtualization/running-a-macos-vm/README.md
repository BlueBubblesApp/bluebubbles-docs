# Running a macOS VM

Expand the sidebar for this page to see various guides to help you set up a macOS VM.

If iMessage will not let you sign in, make sure to follow [enabling-imessage-in-a-vm.md](enabling-imessage-in-a-vm.md "mention").

If you plan to make your VM in Windows, we highly recommend using [VMWare Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion).

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is by no means an easy process, and it is not guaranteed to work. We recommend using real Mac hardware to avoid compromising your Apple ID, you can find cheap Mac Minis (2009) on eBay for around $50-$75.

Feel free to join our Discord, linked in the header above, if you need any help!
