# BYO Proxy Service Guides

By default, BlueBubbles has the Ngrok & Cloudflare proxy services built-into the server for you to utilize. However, these services are run by third parties and are by default, using a free license tier for the respective services. These guides will show you how you can self-host or utilize an existing license of a proxy or dynamic DNS service, to use with BlueBubbles.
